# ARCH_documentation-governance.md — The Registry
> **Owner:** This file owns the registry of every documentation file: what it contains, what it must NOT contain, and when an agent should load it.
> **This file is updated ONLY when the human explicitly requests a "doc sweep" after approving code changes.**

---

## 1. The Living Doc System — Rules Summary

1. **One file owns each rule.** No duplication. If a rule exists in two places, neither source is reliable.
2. **Read before acting.** Load `agent.md` at session start. Load relevant files from this registry before deeper tasks.
3. **Update only on request.** The agent registers new files, enforces ownership, and keeps this registry accurate only when the human explicitly requests a "doc sweep" after approving code changes.
4. **The human checkpoint is the system.** The agent trusts human confirmation as the gate for all doc updates.

### `v5_migration.sql`
| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|

| **Must NOT Contain** | Application logic (lives in the SQL function itself) |
| **Last Updated** | Registered 2026-07-28 (V5.3 doc sweep) — file itself shipped in v5.2.0 |

---

### `v6_domain_scoring_engine.sql`
| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Path** | `/v6_domain_scoring_engine.sql` (root) |
| **Load Trigger** | When touching the Domain Scoring Engine, `PsychE_Modules.scale_min`/`scale_max`/`domain_weight`, or the Tension Matrix |
| **Owns** | `ALTER TABLE "PsychE_Modules"` adding `scale_min`/`scale_max`; `psyche_compute_domain_score()` helper (the item→module→domain hierarchy); the rewritten `calculate_student_telemetry()` (`CREATE OR REPLACE`, same function name/signature as `v5_migration.sql`'s version — **supersedes it in place**, does not run alongside it) |
| **Must NOT Contain** | Application/UI code |
| **Do NOT modify** unless a formal schema migration is approved by the human |
| **Status** | ✅ Run against dev Supabase 2026-07-28. Superseded in part by `v6_1_telemetry_upsert_fix.sql` (its `INSERT` branch had a cross-engine data-loss bug — see `ARCH_technical-specs.md` §8.5). |
| **Last Updated** | 2026-07-28 (V6 domain scoring rewrite, per external psychometrics consultant spec) |

---

### `v6_1_telemetry_upsert_fix.sql`
| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Path** | `/v6_1_telemetry_upsert_fix.sql` (root) |
| **Load Trigger** | When touching either telemetry-writing function's `INSERT` branch, or debugging why `engine_status`/`eti_score` or `metrics_payload` is unexpectedly `NULL` on a fresh row |
| **Owns** | `CREATE OR REPLACE` for `calculate_student_telemetry()` and `psyche_run_daily_batch()` — same scoring math as `v6_domain_scoring_engine.sql`/`v5_analytics_migration.sql`, fixes only the `INSERT` branch of each to carry forward the *other* engine's last-known values instead of nulling them. See `ARCH_technical-specs.md` §8.5 for the full bug writeup. |
| **Must NOT Contain** | Application/UI code |
| **Do NOT modify** unless a formal schema migration is approved by the human |
| **Status** | ✅ Run against production Supabase 2026-07-28 (confirmed by the human), alongside `v6_domain_scoring_engine.sql`. Its `psyche_run_daily_batch()` definition is superseded by `v7_composite_rsi_engine.sql`; its `calculate_student_telemetry()` carry-forward fix remains the live version and is **not** re-issued by V7. |
| **Last Updated** | 2026-07-28 (bug found and fixed same-session as the V6 backfill) |

---

### `v7_composite_rsi_engine.sql`
| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Path** | `/v7_composite_rsi_engine.sql` (root) |
| **Load Trigger** | When touching Composite Score or RSI — their formulas, weights, cohort logic, or the two-pass cron structure |
| **Owns** | `ALTER TABLE "PsychE_Student_Telemetry"` adding `composite_score`/`composite_confidence`/`composite_data`/`rsi_score`/`rsi_data`; `psyche_compute_composite_score()` (pure, per-student, §8.6); `psyche_compute_rsi_for_student()` (cohort percentile with course→grade→school fallback, §8.7); and a `CREATE OR REPLACE` of `psyche_run_daily_batch()` restructured into two passes |
| **Must NOT Contain** | Application/UI code |
| **Do NOT modify** unless a formal schema migration is approved by the human |
| **⚠ Run order** | Must run **after** `v6_domain_scoring_engine.sql` and `v6_1_telemetry_upsert_fix.sql`. It re-issues `psyche_run_daily_batch()` with the V6.1 carry-forward fix already folded in, but does **not** re-issue `calculate_student_telemetry()` — so V6.1 must have been applied first or that function reverts to its buggy form. |
| **Status** | ✅ Run against **dev** Supabase 2026-07-29 and verified end-to-end (composite math hand-checked against the formula for 3 students; RSI percentiles, tie handling, and course→grade→school fallback all confirmed correct). Not yet run in prod. Its `psyche_compute_rsi_for_student()` is superseded by `v7_1_confidence_gating.sql`. |
| **Last Updated** | 2026-07-29 (V7 Composite Score + RSI, per external psychometrics consultant spec; resolves the C↔RSI circular dependency caught in design review) |

---

### `v7_1_confidence_gating.sql`
| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Path** | `/v7_1_confidence_gating.sql` (root) |
| **Load Trigger** | When changing the `CF_C` evidential floor, or debugging why a student has a composite score but no RSI |
| **Owns** | `CREATE OR REPLACE` of `psyche_compute_rsi_for_student()` only — adds the `composite_confidence >= 0.5` eligibility floor (applied to the ranked student, the cohort-size count, and the worse-than count) and the new `insufficient_confidence` reason code. Composite Score math, ETI, Domain Scoring, and `psyche_run_daily_batch()` are untouched. |
| **Must NOT Contain** | Application/UI code |
| **Do NOT modify** unless a formal schema migration is approved by the human |
| **⚠ Run order** | Must run **after** `v7_composite_rsi_engine.sql`. |
| **⚠ Paired constant** | The `0.5` floor exists in two places and must stay in sync: `c_min_confidence` here, and `MIN_COMPOSITE_CONFIDENCE` in `src/types/index.ts` (which drives the frontend display gate). |
| **Status** | ⚠ Written 2026-07-29, **not yet executed against Supabase** (dev or prod). The frontend half of this gate is live and verified in dev; the RSI half needs this file to run. |
| **Last Updated** | 2026-07-29 (fixes a clinical false-positive found in V7 dev verification — see `ARCH_technical-specs.md` §8.6) |

---

### `LIVING_DOC_SYSTEM.md`
| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Path** | `/LIVING_DOC_SYSTEM.md` (root) |
| **Load Trigger** | Only when bootstrapping a new session context from scratch, or re-explaining the system to a new agent |
| **Owns** | The meta-rules governing the entire living doc system (core principles, directory structure ownership definitions) |
| **Must NOT Contain** | Project-specific rules (those live in the files it defines) |
| **Last Updated** | 2026-07-26 (original) |

## 3. Application Source Files (Code Registry)

> These are registered so the agent knows the existing file structure and does not create duplicates.

### `src/App.tsx`
**Purpose:** Route tree definition. All route additions must be made here.

### `src/main.tsx`
**Purpose:** React DOM entry point. Do not modify unless changing render mode.

### `src/lib/supabase.ts`
**Purpose:** Singleton Supabase client. Only file that imports `@supabase/supabase-js`. All pages import from here.

### `src/lib/assessmentEngine.ts`
**Purpose:** Pure scoring functions (reverse-score, module score computation). No Supabase calls.

### `src/lib/capacity.ts`
**Purpose:** V2 scheduling capacity utility functions. No UI code.

### `src/analytics/ColdStart.ts`
**Purpose:** V5 — `EngineStatus` type + `calculateConfidenceMultiplier()`, the frontend-only display ramp for the "Building profile — N% Confidence" badge. Does not call Supabase; pairs with (but does not duplicate) the SQL-side `psyche_get_engine_status()` in `v5_analytics_migration.sql`.

### `src/types/index.ts`
**Purpose:** TypeScript interfaces for all 8 database entities and derived UI shapes. Single source of truth for type definitions.

### `src/index.css`
**Purpose:** Global CSS, design token variables (`:root`), print media queries, utility classes.

### `src/App.css`
**Purpose:** App-level layout rules only (top-level grid, sidebar/content split).

### Components

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/components/Layout.tsx` | Shell layout (sidebar + content area) |
| `src/components/Navbar.tsx` | Navigation sidebar with route links |
| `src/components/PinScreen.tsx` | Glassmorphic PIN authentication gate |
| `src/components/LibraryManager.tsx` | **V3** Assessment CMS — Master-Detail UI |
| `src/components/GlobalTagManager.tsx` | **V3** System Tag management — Data Grid |
| `src/components/AssessmentWizard.tsx` | Step-through assessment administration UI |
| `src/components/LiveAssessmentModal.tsx` | Modal for in-session assessment scoring |
| `src/components/TelemetryPanel.tsx` | **V7.2** Presentational components for the Telemetry Analytics tab (evidence strip, domain profile, tension strip, engagement panel, composite contribution, RSI panel). Pure props-in — no Supabase, no page state. See `GUIDE_developer.md` §9.7 |

### Pages

| File | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` | `/` | Mission Control — Bento Grid |
| `src/pages/StudentProfile.tsx` | `/student/:studentId` | Student bento profile + session history |
| `src/pages/AddLog.tsx` | `/add-log` | New session log form |
| `src/pages/AddStudent.tsx` | `/add-student`, `/edit-student/:id` | Student create/edit form |
| `src/pages/AllLogs.tsx` | `/logs` | Chronological log feed |
| `src/pages/StudentDirectory.tsx` | `/directory` | Filterable student table |
| `src/pages/Settings.tsx` | `/settings` | PsychE_Settings row editor |
| `src/pages/KanbanBoard.tsx` | `/kanban` | 7-day rolling Kanban planner |
| `src/pages/BulkSchedule.tsx` | `/bulk-schedule` | Auto-distribute students |
| `src/pages/Analytics.tsx` | `/analytics` | School-wide aggregate metrics (risk distribution, session health, course breakdown) — not the same as the per-student V5 telemetry engines, see `ARCH_technical-specs.md` §8 |
| `src/pages/ReportExport.tsx` | `/report` | A4 print view (outside Layout) |

---

## 3a. Auxiliary / Legacy Files (not part of the built Vite app)

> Registered so the agent doesn't mistake these for dead code to delete, or for active application code to extend. None of these are imported by `src/App.tsx` or its tree.

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `webhook.js` | Standalone, separate deploy target | Express server (`node webhook.js`) exposing `POST /webhook/import` for external student+log bulk import via `PsychE_Students`/`PsychE_Counseling_Logs` upsert. Uses the frontend's `.env` Supabase vars. Not started by `npm run dev`; not documented as deployed anywhere. |
| `fix_rls.sql` | Superseded, historical | One-off RLS-enable patch for `PsychE_Students`/`PsychE_Counseling_Logs` predating the master schema's own RLS section. Kept for history; the master schema's RLS policies are authoritative now. |
| `refactor.py` | One-off dev script, already run | Python script that mechanically split `StudentProfile.tsx` into the "Profile & History" / "Telemetry Analytics" tab structure (see `GUIDE_developer.md` §9.2). Its edit has already been applied and committed — running it again against the current file will not match its hardcoded markers. Not part of any build step. |
| `src/pages/StudentProfile.backup.tsx` | Stray backup, not imported anywhere | Pre-`refactor.py` snapshot of `StudentProfile.tsx`. Not referenced by any route or import. Left in place pending an explicit cleanup request — not removed in this sweep. |

## 4. Doc Sweep Protocol

When the human explicitly requests a "doc sweep," execute the following:

1. **Review all source file changes** since the last doc sweep.
2. **Update the code registry** above: add new files, remove deleted files, update purpose descriptions.
3. **Check ownership violations:** If a rule was added to the wrong file (e.g., a schema detail added to `GUIDE_developer.md`), move it to the correct owner and note the correction.
4. **Bump `Last Updated`** on any doc file that was modified.
5. **Report summary** to the human: list of files registered, any ownership violations corrected.

---

## 5. Conflict Resolution

If a rule appears in more than one doc file:
1. Identify which file *should* own the rule per the registry above.
2. Remove the rule from the non-owner file.
3. Ensure the owner file has the definitive, up-to-date version.
4. Note the correction in the next doc sweep report.
