--  PsychE Version 7.1 — Composite Score Confidence Gating (RSI eligibility)
--
--  Problem found during V7 dev verification: the V7 spec asserted that
--  "C = null iff all lambda = 0, which in practice only happens when
--  engine_status = cold_start". That assertion is empirically FALSE, because
--  ETI is derived from PsychE_Counseling_Logs (not assessments) — so a
--  cold_start student with zero assessment data can still have lambda_ED = 1.
--
--  Real case (dev): a student with 0 completed sessions, 0 assessment
--  responses, and 2 No_Show logs produced ETI = 0 -> ED = 100 -> C = 100.0
--  at CF_C = 0.25, rendering as "High Load / priority escalation" and
--  RSI = 0 "Significant Outlier" — on no clinical evidence whatsoever.
--  The inverse also occurred: an ETI-only student with ED = 24.4 ranked
--  RSI = 100 "Relatively Thriving".
--
--  Resolution (per consultant): gate on the CONFIDENCE measure, not the
--  formula. The math is structurally sound; what was missing is an
--  evidential floor.
--
--    CF_C = (lambda_DD + lambda_WD + lambda_TS + lambda_ED) / 4
--    Display C only when CF_C >= 0.5  (i.e. >= 2 of 4 components present)
--    Below that -> "Insufficient Assessment Data"
--
--  composite_score is still COMPUTED AND STORED unchanged at any confidence —
--  only its presentation is gated (frontend) and its RSI eligibility is gated
--  (this file). Lowering the threshold later requires no recomputation.
--
--  RSI change: low-confidence students are excluded from cohort rankings
--  entirely — both as ranked subjects and as cohort members. A norm-referenced
--  percentile is only meaningful if the ranked values are commensurable;
--  ranking a 1-component score against a 4-component score is not.
--
--  Idempotent (CREATE OR REPLACE). Only replaces
--  psyche_compute_rsi_for_student(). Does not touch the Composite Score
--  function, the Domain Scoring engine, ETI, or psyche_run_daily_batch()
--  (which calls this function by name and so picks up the new logic).
--  Run AFTER v7_composite_rsi_engine.sql.
