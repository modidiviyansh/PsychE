--  PsychE V7.2 — ETI Follow-Through Fix (phantom pending follow-ups)
--
--  BUG
--  ---
--  "PsychE_Counseling_Logs".follow_up_status is declared
--      follow_up_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending'
--  so ANY log inserted without explicitly setting that column lands as
--  'Pending' — including every log created by AssessmentWizard.tsx, which sets
--  session_status but never follow_up_status. Those rows have
--  follow_up_date IS NULL: no follow-up was ever scheduled, so there is no
--  outstanding obligation to speak of.
--
--  ETI's follow-through term counted them anyway:
--      v_F := 1 - (count(follow_up_status = 'Pending') / total_logs_in_window)
--
--  Net effect in production: the term was depressed for essentially every
--  student by follow-ups that never existed and — because nothing in the app
--  wrote 'Done' until V6 — could never recover. Observed case: a student with
--  4 in-window logs, 3 of them phantom-pending, sat at follow_through = 25%
--  with no possible path upward. F feeds ED -> Composite Score -> RSI, so the
--  error propagated through the entire downstream stack.
--
--  FIX
--  ---
--  Count a follow-up as outstanding only when one was actually scheduled:
--      follow_up_status = 'Pending' AND follow_up_date IS NOT NULL
--
--  'Done'/'Cancelled' remain excluded exactly as before, and the denominator
--  stays total logs in window per the original ETI specification. This change
--  only stops counting obligations that were never created. It is a byte-for-
--  byte copy of the v5_analytics_migration.sql definition with that single
--  FILTER clause amended — no other behaviour is altered.
--
--  No schema change; function replacement only. Run AFTER
--  v5_analytics_migration.sql. Independent of v6/v7 — touches neither domain
--  scoring nor the composite/RSI functions.
--
--  AFTER RUNNING: execute  SELECT psyche_run_daily_batch();  so stored
--  eti_score / composite_score / rsi_score reflect the corrected term.
